# Usage
#### Question: "tell me about capital gain tax? "
#### Answer:  Capital gain tax is a tax on the profit made when an asset, such as stocks, is sold. Currently, Canadians only pay taxes on 50% of capital gains, which disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The government plans to increase the inclusion rate on capital gains above $250,000 by individuals and all capital gains by corporations and trusts from one-half to two-thirds, starting June 25, 2024. The first $250,000 of capital gains income earned by Canadians each year will not be subject to the new two-thirds inclusion rate, in order to ensure that the increase in taxes on capital gains is concentrated among the wealthiest individuals.

#### Question: "what about real estate? "
#### Answer:  The government is committed to addressing tax non-compliance in real estate transactions and implementing measures to protect home buyers from artificial market distortions. They are also considering implementing measures to prevent corporate investors from purchasing and acquiring existing single-family homes, and are providing funding to support municipalities in enforcing short-term rental regulations.

#### Question: "summarize the new taxes implemented in this budget? "
#### Answer:  The new Budget 2024 proposes an Alternative Minimum Tax proposal and funding for the Federal Information Network to improve the integrity of the tax system. It also includes funding for the Privy Council Office to enhance physical and cyber security. Additionally, there are investments to simplify tax services and prevent wealthy individuals from using foreign shell companies to avoid paying Canadian tax.
